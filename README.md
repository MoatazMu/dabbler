# Dabbler Flutter App

Dabbler is a Flutter application. This repository tracks the mobile codebase and uses two primary branches:

- **main**: The primary development branch that accumulates changes after review.
- **release/v1.0.0**: A release branch cut from `main` and kept aligned for production/Play Store builds.

Use `flutter pub get` to install dependencies before running the app, and keep secrets in a local `.env` file (see `.gitignore`).
