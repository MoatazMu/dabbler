# Social, Ratings, Stats MVP review

## Social (view profile + participants)
- [Over-scope] Home quick actions still deep-link into the full social feed (`RoutePaths.social`), and feature flags keep the community stack enabled, exposing excluded posts/friends flows. Disable the CTA and flip the social-related flags off for the MVP build. 【F:lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart†L242-L272】【F:lib/core/config/feature_flags.dart†L75-L89】
- [Missing] The game detail “Players” list renders three placeholder rows and never reads the loaded roster from `GameDetailState`, so participants can’t see who has joined. Replace the dummy `List.generate` block with the controller’s `players` collection. 【F:lib/features/games/presentation/screens/join_game/game_detail_screen.dart†L452-L516】
- [Missing] Neither the “View All” button nor the individual player rows navigate to `UserProfileScreen`; the handler just prints to console. Wire these taps to push the tapped player’s profile so users can inspect teammates. 【F:lib/features/games/presentation/screens/join_game/game_detail_screen.dart†L469-L508】【F:lib/features/games/presentation/screens/join_game/game_detail_screen.dart†L893-L895】
- [Over-scope] The organizer header exposes a “message” icon even though in-app chat is out of scope; it only shows a snackbar today, but the CTA invites a non-MVP flow. Hide the icon or gate it behind a post-MVP flag. 【F:lib/features/games/presentation/screens/join_game/game_detail_screen.dart†L720-L904】

## Ratings
- [Missing] Post-game feedback only solicits a single “Rate this game” score from the Activities screen, with no UI to rate teammates, so the required player-rating flow is absent. Introduce a player roster picker with star inputs after each game instead of the game-level prompt. 【F:lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/activities_screen_v2.dart†L125-L250】
- [Over-scope] The same modal posts to `GamesRepository.rateGame`, and the Supabase datasource stubs out `submitGameRating`, which is an excluded game-rating feature. Remove that prompt for MVP to avoid encouraging non-supported ratings. 【F:lib/features/games/data/repositories/games_repository_impl.dart†L656-L684】【F:lib/features/games/data/datasources/supabase_games_datasource.dart†L867-L884】
- [Missing] There is no surface to view “My ratings” despite repository methods like `listAboutMe`; expose a simple list or tile so players can review feedback they’ve received. 【F:lib/data/repositories/ratings_repository_impl.dart†L37-L66】

## Stats
- [MVP OK] Profile screens already surface the required basics—games played, win rate, and average rating—inside the “Activity snapshot” card. Keep this card as the core stats module. 【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L707-L776】
- [Missing] The snapshot never shows a win/loss breakdown, only a percentage. Add explicit wins and losses (or a W/L record) alongside the counts per MVP requirements. 【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L734-L776】
- [Over-scope] Profile rewards inject leaderboard rankings, tiers, points, and achievements, and the CTA jumps to a dedicated leaderboard route—all outside MVP. Hide `ProfileRewardsWidget` (and the leaderboard button) until rewards launch. 【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L963-L981】【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/profile_rewards_widget.dart†L18-L140】
- [Over-scope] The Activities “Stats” tab charts Payments, Social, Rewards, and Community categories, signaling non-MVP systems. Limit the grid to football game stats for now. 【F:lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/activities_screen_v2.dart†L713-L1078】
