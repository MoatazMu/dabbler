# Profile & Sport Profile MVP Review

## Scope creep beyond MVP
| Feature | Status | File(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile type selection allows organiser | Over-scope | `lib/features/authentication/presentation/providers/onboarding_data_provider.dart` | Onboarding data still maps an "organise" intention to `profile_type = organiser`, so non-player profiles remain reachable; clamp onboarding to player-only for MVP.【F:lib/features/authentication/presentation/providers/onboarding_data_provider.dart†L5-L116】 |
| Multi-sport onboarding carousel | Over-scope | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/onboarding/onboarding_sports_screen.dart` | Sports step lists dozens of non-football options with skill tracking, contradicting the single-football onboarding scope; replace with a fixed football selection for MVP.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/onboarding/onboarding_sports_screen.dart†L40-L205】 |
| Profile edit forms capture out-of-scope fields | Over-scope | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile_edit_screen.dart`, `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart` | Both edit flows expose gender, phone, and multi-sport chips instead of limiting edits to name, bio, avatar, and location; strip these extras or hide them behind non-MVP flags.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile_edit_screen.dart†L20-L209】【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart†L16-L210】 |
| Sports preferences hub exposes multi-sport & automation | Over-scope | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart` | Screen lets users toggle many sports, auto-join games, and trigger game creation, all outside the football-only MVP; constrain it to a single football profile and remove automation toggles.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart†L25-L520】 |
| Profile surface shows completion meters, rewards, and leaderboards | Over-scope | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart`, `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/profile/profile_completion_indicator.dart` | The profile page promotes completion scores, rewards widgets, and leaderboard links, none of which are part of the MVP; hide these modules until post-MVP.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L410-L780】【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L952-L979】【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/profile/profile_completion_indicator.dart†L4-L199】 |
| Profile models carry verification, geolocation, and advanced preferences | Over-scope | `lib/data/models/profile/user_profile.dart`, `lib/data/models/profile/sports_profile.dart` | Data layer still stores verified badges, geo coordinates, certifications, achievements, and other advanced traits that should stay dormant for MVP; gate these columns or ignore them in the player-facing API.【F:lib/data/models/profile/user_profile.dart†L18-L173】【F:lib/data/models/profile/sports_profile.dart†L1-L103】 |

## Missing or broken MVP requirements
| Feature | Status | File(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile edit lacks bio & location inputs | Missing | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile_edit_screen.dart`, `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart` | Neither edit flow offers fields for bio or city/country even though the profile view expects them; add controlled text inputs for these basics.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile_edit_screen.dart†L99-L209】【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart†L118-L209】 |
| Football-only sport profile | Missing | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart` | Users can enable multiple sports and positions, so we never enforce the single-football profile; lock the list to football and drop the multi-sport switches.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart†L309-L396】 |
| Skill level limited to three tiers | Missing | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart`, `lib/data/models/profile/sports_profile.dart` | UI and models surface four levels (Beginner–Expert) and a numeric 1–10 scale, exceeding the three-level requirement; trim enums and storage to Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced only.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile/profile_screen.dart†L923-L949】【F:lib/data/models/sport_profile.dart†L6-L22】 |
| Years of experience capture | Missing | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart` | Sports preferences save `years_of_experience` as 0 with no UI to edit it, so the required "years playing" field is absent; add a numeric input tied to Supabase.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_sports_screen.dart†L552-L570】 |

## Items currently meeting scope
| Feature | Status | File(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avatar management screen | OK | `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_avatar_screen.dart` | Users can review their current avatar, pick from defaults, or upload a new image, satisfying the MVP requirement for avatar editing.【F:lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/settings/profile_avatar_screen.dart†L7-L165】 |
