# Auth & Onboarding vs MVP Review

## Scope creep beyond MVP
- **Profile onboarding still exposes multi-sport + skill UI.** `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/onboarding/onboarding_sports_screen.dart` builds four sport categories with basketball, tennis, rugby, yoga, etc., and tracks per-sport skill levels/interests, so a football-only player can wander into non-MVP sports during onboarding. _Fix:_ Gate this screen behind the same football-only configuration (or remove it from navigation) so only football is surfaced and skill sliders are hidden for MVP.
- **Advanced preference capture bundled into onboarding.** `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/onboarding/onboarding_preferences_screen.dart` collects city/area filters, distance sliders, weekly availability, and game format toggles—none of which ship in the MVP brief. _Fix:_ Hide or strip this entire step until the broader preference system is scheduled post-MVP.
- **Copy still promises multi-sport interests.** `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/sports_selection_screen.dart` tells users to “Select your preferred sport and additional interests” and references “up to 3 additional sports,” which contradicts the football-only MVP even though the data layer is restricted. _Fix:_ Update the copy/CTA to emphasise football-only to avoid confusing players.

## Missing or broken required fields/flows
- **Email sign-ups can finish without a player profile.** In `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/set_password_screen.dart`, the app creates the Supabase auth user, then immediately reads `authService.getCurrentUser()` to insert the profile. When Supabase returns no active session (common when email confirmation is required), the call returns `null`, the profile insert is skipped, and the player reaches the welcome screen without stored age/gender/sport data. _Fix:_ Retry profile creation after ensuring a valid session (or move the profile insert behind an RPC that runs regardless of session state) before marking onboarding complete.

## Technical risks / UX gaps
- **Phone onboarding hard-codes a UAE number format.** `lib/features/misc/presentation/screens/phone_input_screen.dart` validates against `^5\d{8}` and prefixes `+971`, so any non-UAE number is rejected even though the MVP scope does not limit geography. _Fix:_ Either expose a country picker or relax validation to accept generic E.164 numbers for launch markets.
