# unDraw illustrations

This folder is meant for optional unDraw illustrations used in empty states.

## Friends empty state
- Download any illustration you like from https://undraw.co/illustrations
- Export as **SVG** and save it as:
  - `assets/images/undraw/empty_friends.svg`

The UI will automatically show the SVG if present; otherwise it falls back to an icon.

### Theming
The renderer auto-remaps common unDraw palette colors (like `#6c63ff`, `#ff6584`, `#3f3d56`) to the current Material 3 `ColorScheme`, so the illustration matches light/dark mode.
